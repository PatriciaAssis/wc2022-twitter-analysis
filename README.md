# wc2022-twitter-analysis
This project explores the public reaction on Twitter to Portugal's unexpected loss against Morocco during the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Using a dataset of 190,907 tweets described by 30 features, collected around the day of the match and the day before and after, we applied a combination of keyword filtering and Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify football-related content and classify sentiment toward the Portuguese national team. We conducted exploratory data analysis to identify peak activity periods, influential users, and trending topics. As focus, we analyzed sentiment patterns throughout the day, uncovering a significant spike in negative tweets during and immediately after the match. Topic- specific analyses uncovered criticism targeting coach Fernando Santos and star Cristiano Ronaldo, alongside widespread praise for Moroccoâ€™s historic run. Visualizations such as line plots, bar charts, and heatmaps were used to support our findings. This study offers insight into how real-time sports events influence public sentiment and engagement on social media, especially when national expectations are disrupted by surprise outcomes.
